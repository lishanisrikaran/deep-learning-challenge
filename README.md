# deep-learning-challenge

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 

Alphabet Soup’s business team, provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Using knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, the relevant features in the provided dataset are used to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The following are contained in this repository:
- The AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb - This contains the inital deep learning model
- The AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb - This contains the an adapted deep learning model which optimises the initial model's performance
- H5 files for AlphabetSoupCharity and AlphabetSoupCharity
- A report which summarises the results of the models created

The ipynb files were coded in Google Collaboratory and downloaded; you can upload the ipynb into your relative Google Collaboratory to rerun without prerequisite installations.
